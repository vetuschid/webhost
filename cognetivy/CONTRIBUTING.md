# Contributing to Cognetivy

Thank you for your interest in contributing. This document explains how to get set up, run tests, and submit changes.

## Code of Conduct

This project follows the [Contributor Covenant](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you agree to uphold it.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** ≥ 18
- Git

### Development setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/meitarbe/cognetivy.git
   cd cognetivy
   ```

2. **CLI (main package)**
   ```bash
   cd cli
   npm install
   npm run build
   npm test
   ```

3. **Studio (React UI)**  -  optional for CLI-only work
   ```bash
   cd studio
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```
   To develop the Studio with hot reload, see [studio/README.md](studio/README.md).

4. **Full build** (CLI + Studio, from `cli/`)
   ```bash
   cd cli
   npm run build:full
   ```

## Running tests

- From `cli/`: `npm test` (builds and runs Node test runner).
- Tests live in `cli/test/` (e.g. `init.test.mjs`, `run-events.test.mjs`, `collections.test.mjs`).

## Submitting changes

1. **Fork** the repo and create a branch from `main` (e.g. `fix/thing` or `feat/thing`).
2. Make your changes. Keep the scope focused; prefer smaller PRs.
3. Ensure `npm run build` and `npm test` pass in `cli/`.
4. Open a **Pull Request** against `main` with a clear description and, if applicable, a link to the related issue.
5. Address any review feedback.

We welcome first-time contributors. Look for issues labeled **good first issue** if you want a suggested starting point.
