# Polymarket Broker Examples

Examples demonstrating `PolymarketBetEnv`, a one-shot betting environment for
short-cadence binary markets on [Polymarket](https://polymarket.com/).

Polymarket runs continuous **5-minute, 15-minute, 1-hour, and 4-hour** crypto
"up/down" markets (BTC, ETH, SOL) plus daily markets. Each market is a binary
bet: did the asset go up or down over the bar? The env rolls through the
series, bet → wait for resolution → collect payoff → next market, without
holding any position across steps.

All examples default to `dry_run=True`, so you can run them without a funded
Polygon wallet or `py-clob-client` installed.

## End-to-end walkthrough

A complete tour in five steps: **discover → identify → configure → run**.

### 1. Discover what's available

Use `scan_markets.py` to query the live Gamma API. With no flags it returns
the highest-volume open markets. Add `--slug-prefix` once you know what you
want, same primitive the env uses, so what you see here is what the env will
trade:

```bash
# Browse high-volume markets
python examples/broker/polymarket/scan_markets.py

# Look at upcoming short-cadence crypto markets
python examples/broker/polymarket/scan_markets.py --max-resolution-minutes 30 --max 8

# Lock to the BTC 5-minute series
python examples/broker/polymarket/scan_markets.py --slug-prefix btc-updown-5m- --max 5
```

Sample output for the BTC 5m query:

```
  YES |     24h vol |   liquidity |       resolves | slug
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 0.51 | $     1,690 | $    18,110 |       in    3m | btc-updown-5m-1777284300
 0.51 | $        72 | $    21,010 |       in    8m | btc-updown-5m-1777284600
 0.51 | $        15 | $    18,054 |       in   53m | btc-updown-5m-1777287300
 0.51 | $        15 | $    14,635 |       in  1.7h | btc-updown-5m-1777290300
 0.51 | $        10 | $    14,670 |       in  1.4h | btc-updown-5m-1777289100
```

#### Column reference

| Column | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `YES`       | Implied probability of "Up" (the YES outcome), in `[0, 1]`. `0.51` ≈ 51 % chance. |
| `24h vol`   | USDC traded against this market in the trailing 24 h. Short-cadence markets typically show ~$0 until minutes before resolution. |
| `liquidity` | USDC currently resting on the order book. Higher = lower slippage. |
| `resolves`  | Time until resolution, formatted as `Xm` / `Xh` / date. |
| `slug`      | The market's stable identifier on Polymarket. The **prefix** (everything before the trailing timestamp / strike) is what the env locks onto. |

#### CLI flags

| Flag                       | Default | Description |
|----------------------------|---------|-------------|
| `--slug-prefix`            | *(none)* | Case-sensitive prefix match on the market slug, the env-side primitive. Use it once you know what you want. |
| `--keyword`                | *(none)* | One or more case-insensitive substrings; ANY-match against question/slug. Useful for fuzzy discovery. |
| `--min-volume`             | `0`      | Minimum 24 h volume (USD). |
| `--min-liquidity`          | `0`      | Minimum order-book liquidity (USD). |
| `--min-resolution-hours`   | `0`      | Lower bound on time-to-resolution. |
| `--max-resolution-minutes` | *(none)* | Upper bound on time-to-resolution. Set to e.g. `30` to surface short-cadence markets that volume-sorted browsing would miss. |
| `--max`                    | `20`     | Cap on rows printed. |

### 2. Identify the slug prefix

The `slug` column above shows individual markets like `btc-updown-5m-1777284300`.
The trailing number is a per-market epoch; the **prefix** `btc-updown-5m-` is
the stable series identifier. Currently active short-cadence series include:

| Series | Cadence | Slug prefix |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| BTC up/down (5 min)   | 5 min  | `btc-updown-5m-` |
| BTC up/down (15 min)  | 15 min | `btc-updown-15m-` |
| BTC up/down (1 hour)  | 1 h    | `bitcoin-up-or-down-` |
| BTC up/down (4 hour)  | 4 h    | `btc-updown-4h-` |
| ETH up/down (5 min)   | 5 min  | `eth-updown-5m-` |
| ETH up/down (15 min)  | 15 min | `eth-updown-15m-` |
| SOL up/down (5 min)   | 5 min  | `sol-updown-5m-` |
| BTC daily up/down     | 1 day  | `bitcoin-up-or-down-on-` |

Polymarket's slug naming isn't perfectly consistent (5m / 15m / 4h use `btc`
abbreviations; 1h and daily use full `bitcoin`), so re-running `scan_markets.py`
once before configuring the env is the safe move.

### 3. Configure the env

Plug the prefix into `PolymarketBetEnvConfig`:

```python
from torchtrade.envs.live.polymarket import PolymarketBetEnv, PolymarketBetEnvConfig

config = PolymarketBetEnvConfig(
    market_slug_prefix="btc-updown-5m-",   # the only required field
    bet_fraction=0.01,                     # stake 1 % of cash per bet
    max_steps=10,                          # 10 bets per episode
    initial_cash=1_000.0,                  # for dry-run accounting
    dry_run=True,                          # skip real CLOB orders
)
env = PolymarketBetEnv(config, private_key="")  # private_key only needed when dry_run=False
```

Swapping to ETH 15-minute is a one-line change:

```python
config = PolymarketBetEnvConfig(market_slug_prefix="eth-updown-15m-")
```

### 4. Inspect the observation

`reset()` returns a `TensorDict` with a single key, `market_state` of the
freshly-picked next market:

```python
td = env.reset()
td["market_state"]
# tensor([yes_price, spread, vol_24h, liquidity])  shape (4,)
```

There is **no** `account_state`. By the time the next `step()` runs, the
previous bet has already resolved, there is no carried position to encode.
Cumulative P&L is captured directly in the per-step rewards.

### 5. Step the env

Each `step()` does five things:

```
1. Submit the bet on the current market (skipped in dry_run)
2. Sleep until the market's endDate + grace
3. Poll the CLOB midpoint for each outcome token; resolved when YES mid >= 0.99
   and NO mid <= 0.01 (Up won) or vice versa (Down won)
4. Compute realized payoff:  win → stake * (1 - fill) / fill, loss → -stake
5. Pick the next active market matching market_slug_prefix and return its market_state
```

```python
import torch

td = env.reset()
for _ in range(config.max_steps):
    action = torch.randint(0, env.action_spec.n, ())  # 0 = Down, 1 = Up
    td = env.step(td.set("action", action))["next"]
    if td["done"]: break
env.close()
```

The runnable equivalent, with a random policy and progress prints, is
[`run_dry_run.py`](run_dry_run.py).

## Examples

### `scan_markets.py`: discover

See section 1 above.

### `run_dry_run.py`: bet end-to-end

```bash
python examples/broker/polymarket/run_dry_run.py
python examples/broker/polymarket/run_dry_run.py --slug-prefix btc-updown-15m- --max-steps 4
```

Note: the script blocks until each market resolves, so default 5-minute / 2-step
takes ~10–15 minutes wall-clock. Use `--slug-prefix btc-updown-5m-` and
`--max-steps 1` for the quickest end-to-end test.

## Action-space convention

`Categorical(2)` over `{0: Down, 1: Up}`, indexing into the market's `["Up",
"Down"]` outcomes. An LLM actor can prompt over the question text and emit a
discrete index; an RL policy gets logits over two classes.

## Running for real

To trade real funds:

1. Set `POLYGON_PRIVATE_KEY` in `.env`, the wallet must hold USDC.e on Polygon.
2. `pip install py-clob-client`.
3. Set `dry_run=False` in `PolymarketBetEnvConfig`.

Always start with `dry_run=True` and verify the bet timing, payoff
computation, and accounting before flipping the switch.
