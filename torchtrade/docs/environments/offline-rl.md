# Offline RL

TorchTrade supports **offline reinforcement learning**, enabling agents to learn from pre-collected datasets without requiring live environment interaction during training.

## Overview

TorchTrade provides **TensorDict-based datasets** that can be loaded and used directly with [TorchRL's replay buffer](https://docs.pytorch.org/rl/main/tutorials/rb_tutorial.html). These datasets are available for download from [HuggingFace/Torch-Trade](https://huggingface.co/Torch-Trade) and contain pre-collected trading trajectories for offline RL research.

Offline RL can be performed using datasets collected from two sources:

1. **Offline Environment Interactions** - Collect trajectories by running policies in backtesting environments (SequentialTradingEnv, SequentialTradingEnvSLTP, etc.)
2. **Real Online Environment Interactions** - Record actual trading data from live exchanges (Alpaca, Binance, Bitget)

This approach is particularly valuable for:
- Learning from expert demonstrations or historical trading data
- Training without market risk or transaction costs
- Developing policies when live interaction is expensive or dangerous
- Bootstrapping learning before deploying to real markets

## Example: IQL (Implicit Q-Learning)

TorchTrade provides an example implementation of offline RL using **Implicit Q-Learning (IQL)** in `examples/offline/iql/`.

```python
# Example: Training IQL on pre-collected dataset
from torchtrade.envs.offline import SequentialTradingEnv, SequentialTradingEnvConfig
from torchrl.collectors import SyncDataCollector
from torchrl.data import LazyTensorStorage, TensorDictReplayBuffer

# 1. Create environment (for evaluation only)
env = SequentialTradingEnv(df, config)

# 2. Load pre-collected dataset
# Dataset should contain trajectories: (observation, action, reward, next_observation, done)
replay_buffer = TensorDictReplayBuffer(
    storage=LazyTensorStorage(max_size=1_000_000),
)

# 3. Train IQL from offline data
for batch in replay_buffer:
    loss = iql_loss_module(batch)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
```

For a complete implementation, see [examples/offline/iql/](https://github.com/TorchTrade/torchtrade/tree/main/examples/offline/iql).

## Dataset Collection

### From Offline Environments

```python
from torchtrade.envs.offline import SequentialTradingEnv, SequentialTradingEnvConfig
from torchrl.collectors import SyncDataCollector
from torchrl.data import LazyTensorStorage, TensorDictReplayBuffer

# Collect trajectories with any policy (random, rule-based, pre-trained)
collector = SyncDataCollector(
    env,
    policy,
    frames_per_batch=10000,
    total_frames=1_000_000,
)

# Store in replay buffer
replay_buffer = TensorDictReplayBuffer(
    storage=LazyTensorStorage(max_size=1_000_000),
)

for batch in collector:
    replay_buffer.extend(batch)
```

### From Real Online Environments

```python
from torchtrade.envs.alpaca import AlpacaTorchTradingEnv, AlpacaTradingEnvConfig

# Collect real trading data (paper trading recommended)
env = AlpacaTorchTradingEnv(config)

# Record interactions
for episode in range(num_episodes):
    td = env.reset()
    while not td["done"].item():
        action = policy(td)
        td = env.step(td)
        replay_buffer.add(td)
```

## Provided Datasets

!!! todo "Coming Soon"
    We plan to provide pre-collected datasets on HuggingFace for offline RL research, including:

    - Expert demonstrations from rule-based strategies
    - Random policy trajectories for benchmarking
    - Real market interaction data (paper trading)

    Stay tuned at [HuggingFace/Torch-Trade](https://huggingface.co/Torch-Trade)!
