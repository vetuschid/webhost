class CoverageTracker(Transform):
    """Transform that tracks both episode start diversity and full state visitation coverage.

    Only tracks coverage during training (when environment has random_start=True).
    Does not affect test/evaluation environments.

    The tracker monitors two types of coverage:
    1. Reset Coverage: Which starting positions (reset_index) are used for episode starts
    2. State Coverage: All timesteps (state_index) visited during episodes

    This dual tracking is useful for:
    - Ensuring comprehensive coverage of training data
    - Distinguishing between episode start diversity vs full trajectory coverage
    - Identifying under-sampled regions of the dataset
    - Curriculum learning strategies
    - Detecting overfitting to specific market conditions

        INTERPRETING THE METRICS:

        Coverage Fraction (reset_coverage, state_coverage):
            - Range: [0.0, 1.0] where 0.0 = no coverage, 1.0 = complete coverage
            - Measures: What fraction of dataset positions have been visited
            - Good values: >0.8 indicates broad exploration
            - Bad values: <0.3 suggests concentrated sampling (potential overfitting)
            - Note: Reset coverage can be much lower than state coverage since episodes
              start at specific positions but then traverse many subsequent states

        Reset vs State Coverage:
            - reset_coverage: Diversity of episode starting points
            - state_coverage: Diversity of all states seen during episodes (includes
              all timesteps from reset to done, not just episode starts)
            - Key insight: state_coverage should be significantly higher than
              reset_coverage because episodes traverse many states after starting.
              If they're similar, episodes might be too short or agent is resetting
              too frequently.

        Example interpretations:
            - reset_coverage=0.3, state_coverage=0.9: Good! Starting from 30% of
              positions but exploring 90% of dataset through episode trajectories
            - reset_coverage=0.5, state_coverage=0.5: Warning! Agent only seeing
              states near episode starts, not exploring forward in time

        Returns:
            Dictionary containing coverage metrics:
            - enabled (bool): Whether tracking is active
            - total_positions (int): Total number of positions in dataset

            Reset coverage (episode start diversity):
            - reset_visited (int): Number of unique starting positions used
