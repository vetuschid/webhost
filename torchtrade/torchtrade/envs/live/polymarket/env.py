"""PolymarketBetEnv, rolling one-shot bets on a Polymarket market series.

Pattern B (contextual-bandit shape): each step is an independent bet on a
fresh, short-cadence binary market, bet on direction, wait for resolution,
collect the realized payoff, then move to the next market in the series.

Concrete example (5-minute Bitcoin up/down):

    env = PolymarketBetEnv(config, dry_run=True)

    td = env.reset()
